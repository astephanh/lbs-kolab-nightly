kolab-syncroton for Debian
--------------------------
If you install kolab-syncroton after setup-kolab has been run,
you will need to run the syncroton SQL script against the
roundcube database manually.

If you install kolab-syncroton first, setup-kolab will take care of things for you.

The script is located in /usr/share/doc/kolab-syncroton/syncroton.sql.
